New feature of the check presence v2.0 compared to check presence v1.0:
  In check presence v2.0, the previous data will not be lost if we end the programm and re-compile
or if your PC suddenly stop working so you can do other thing. You don't need to fear blackout either.

In both repositories, It's impossible to do multiple check at once
